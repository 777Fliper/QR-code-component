# QR-code-component
This is a solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 
# Built with:
- Basic HTML&CSS
- Flexbox

# What I learned
- I haven't been programing for a while so I reminded myself basics of html and css.
- This is my first project published on GitHub, I learned how to use it.
- For the frist time I also used [netlify](netlify.com), now you can see my website here -> [QR-code-component](https://qr-code-component-777.netlify.app)

# Continued development
Right now I want to learn how to make responsive websites. That was the factor I had most problems making this website.
